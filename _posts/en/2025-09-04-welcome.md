**Welcome!** This blog experiments at the interface of _materials science_ and _philosophy of science_.

- Short, reproducible technical notes (Jekyll, data, simulation tips).
- Essays on modeling assumptions, evidence, and explanation.
- Reading logs and paper highlights.

If you prefer German, switch languages using the toggle in the footer. AMAZING
